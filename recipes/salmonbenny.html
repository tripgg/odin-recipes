        <h2>How to make the eggs</h3>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>4 Eggs</li>
                <li>2 tbsp white wine vinegar</li>
                <li>2 english muffins, halved</li>
                <li>a little butter, for spreading</li>
                <li>8 slices smoked salmon</li>
                <li>chopped chives, to serve</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>For the hollandaise sauce</h4>
            <li>2 tsp lemon juice</li>
            <li>2 tsp white wine vinegar</li>
            <li>3 egg yolks</li>
            <li>125g unsalted butter, diced</li>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>First make the hollandaise sauce. Put the lemon juice and vinegar in a small bowl, add the egg yolks and whisk with a balloon whisk until light and frothy. Place the bowl over a pan of simmering water and whisk until mixture thickens. Gradually add the butter, whisking constantly until thick â€“ if it looks like it might be splitting, then whisk off the heat for a few mins. Season and keep warm.</li>
                <li>To poach the eggs, bring a large pan of water to the boil and add the vinegar. Lower the heat so that the water is simmering gently. Stir the water so you have a slight whirlpool, then slide in the eggs one by one. Cook each for about 4 mins, then remove with a slotted spoon.</li>
                <li>Lightly toast and butter the muffins, then put a couple of slices of salmon on each half. Top each with an egg, spoon over some hollandaise and garnish with chopped chives.</li>
            </ol>
