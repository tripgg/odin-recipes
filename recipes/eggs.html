        <h2>How to make the eggs</h3>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>6 Eggs</li>
                <li>15g Butter</li>
                <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
                <li>Creme Fraiche(Sour Cream)</li>
                <li>Chives</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a deep saucepan, crack 6 cold eggs. To make smaller batches, use a 2-to-1 egg-to-butter ratio.</li>
                <li>Put the pan on high heat, and add the butter.</li>
                <li>Stir and turn the eggs constantly with a rubber spatula until they start to thicken, scraping the bottom of the pan as you go.</li>
                <li>After 30 seconds, take the pan off the heat but keep stirring. Put the heat back on after about 10 seconds. Repeat this process for 3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove the eggs from the heat at the last minute and season lightly with salt and pepper. For an extra creamy texture, stir in 1 tbsp of creme fraiche (sour cream).</li>
                <li>Serve with chopped chives as a garnish.</li>
            </ol>
